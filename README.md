# Music Lounge

Small app that recommends similar artists created using TasteDive API.
Using Spotify API to get the artist images, clicking the image takes you to the Spotify artist page.

I implemented the refresh token call on Spotify too since Spotify tokens expire after 1 hour.

Tech stack used:
- React
- TypeScript
